This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering", which can be found [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). We further provide the reference images used to create the error metrics reported in the paper, as well as recently created, pre-trained models. 

## Step-by-step Tutorial

Jonathan Stephens made a fantastic step-by-step tutorial for setting up Gaussian Splatting on your machine, along with instructions for creating usable datasets from videos. If the instructions below are too dry for you, go ahead and check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtuigy_wYc).


## Cloning the Repository

The repository contains submodules, thus please check it out with 
```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/suNoeul/gaussian-splatting.git --recursive
```

## Overview

The codebase has 4 main components:
- A PyTorch-based optimizer to produce a 3D Gaussian model from SfM inputs
- A network viewer that allows to connect to and visualize the optimization process
- An OpenGL-based real-time viewer to render trained models in real-time.
- A script to help you turn your own images into optimization-ready SfM data sets

The components have different requirements w.r.t. both hardware and software. They have been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04. Instructions for setting up and running each of them are found in the sections below.


## Optimizer

The optimizer uses PyTorch and CUDA extensions in a Python environment to produce trained models. 

### Hardware Requirements

- CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- 24 GB VRAM (to train to paper evaluation quality)
- Please see FAQ for smaller VRAM configurations

### Software Requirements
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- C++ Compiler for PyTorch extensions (we used Visual Studio 2019 for Windows)
- CUDA SDK 11 for PyTorch extensions, install *after* Visual Studio (we used 11.8, **known issues with 11.6**)
- C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK must be compatible

### Setup

#### Local Setup

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```
위 명령어가 잘 동작하지 않아서, 별도로 아래와 같이 환경 구성
```bash
# conda channel 약관 동의
conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r

conda create -n gaussian_splatting python=3.7 -y
conda activate gaussian_splatting

conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -y
conda install -c conda-forge plyfile tqdm -y

# 1. 일반 PyPI 패키지 설치
pip install opencv-python joblib

# 2. 컴파일이 필요한 로컬 서브모듈 설치
pip install ./submodules/simple-knn
pip install ./submodules/fused-ssim
pip install ./submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
```
Please note that this process assumes that you have CUDA SDK **11** installed, not **12**. For modifications, see below.

Tip: Downloading packages and creating a new environment with Conda can require a significant amount of disk space. By default, Conda will use the main system hard drive. You can avoid this by specifying a different package download location and an environment on a different drive:

```shell
conda config --add pkgs_dirs <Drive>/<pkg_path>
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
conda activate <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
```

#### Modifications

If you can afford the disk space, we recommend using our environment files for setting up a training environment identical to ours. If you want to make modifications, please note that major version changes might affect the results of our method. However, our (limited) experiments suggest that the codebase works just fine inside a more up-to-date environment (Python 3.8, PyTorch 2.0.0, CUDA 12). Make sure to create an environment where PyTorch and its CUDA runtime version match and the installed CUDA SDK has no major version difference with PyTorch's CUDA version.

#### Known Issues

Some users experience problems building the submodules on Windows (```cl.exe: File not found``` or similar). Please consider the workaround for this problem from the FAQ.

Note that similar to MipNeRF360, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. For convenience, arbitrary-size inputs can be passed and will be automatically resized if their width exceeds 1600 pixels. We recommend to keep this behavior, but you may force training to use your higher-resolution images by setting ```-r 1```.

The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/). You can find our SfM data sets for Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip). If you do not provide an output model directory (```-m```), trained models are written to folders with randomized unique names inside the ```output``` directory. At this point, the trained models may be viewed with the real-time viewer (see further below).

### Evaluation
By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:
```shell
# python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --eval # Train with train/test split
# python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
# python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings

# 1. 학습 (모델 경로 지정)
python train.py \
  -s ~/workspace/data/tandt/truck \
  -m ~/workspace/code/gaussian-splatting/output/gs_truck_r2_safe \
  --eval \
  -r 2 \
  --data_device cpu

# 2. 렌더링 (train/test 둘 다)
python render.py -m ~/workspace/code/gaussian-splatting/output/gs_truck_r2_safe

# 3. 메트릭 계산
python metrics.py -m ~/workspace/code/gaussian-splatting/output/gs_truck_r2_safe

```

If you want to evaluate our [pre-trained models](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/pretrained/models.zip), you will have to download the corresponding source data sets and indicate their location to ```render.py``` with an additional ```--source_path/-s``` flag. Note: The pre-trained models were created with the release codebase. This code base has been cleaned up and includes bugfixes, hence the metrics you get from evaluating them will differ from those in the paper.
```shell
python render.py -m <path to pre-trained model> -s <path to COLMAP dataset>
python metrics.py -m <path to pre-trained model>
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for render.py</span></summary>

  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path to the trained model directory you want to create renderings for.
  #### --skip_train
  Flag to skip rendering the training set.
  #### --skip_test
  Flag to skip rendering the test set.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe. 

  **The below parameters will be read automatically from the model path, based on what was used for training. However, you may override them by providing them explicitly on the command line.** 

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.
  #### --resolution / -r
  Changes the resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. ```1``` by default.
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --convert_SHs_python
  Flag to make pipeline render with computed SHs from PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --convert_cov3D_python
  Flag to make pipeline render with computed 3D covariance from PyTorch instead of ours.

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for metrics.py</span></summary>

  #### --model_paths / -m 
  Space-separated list of model paths for which metrics should be computed.
</details>
<br>

We further provide the ```full_eval.py``` script. This script specifies the routine used in our evaluation and demonstrates the use of some additional parameters, e.g., ```--images (-i)``` to define alternative image directories within COLMAP data sets. If you have downloaded and extracted all the training data, you can run it like this:
```shell
python full_eval.py -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```
In the current version, this process takes about 7h on our reference machine containing an A6000. If you want to do the full evaluation on our pre-trained models, you can specify their download location and skip training. 
```shell
python full_eval.py -o <directory with pretrained models> --skip_training -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```

If you want to compute the metrics on our paper's [evaluation images](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/evaluation/images.zip), you can also skip rendering. In this case it is not necessary to provide the source datasets. You can compute metrics for multiple image sets at a time. 
```shell
python full_eval.py -m <directory with evaluation images>/garden ... --skip_training --skip_rendering
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for full_eval.py</span></summary>
  
  #### --skip_training

  #### --skip_rendering
  Flag to skip rendering stage.
  #### --skip_metrics

## Processing your own Scenes

Our COLMAP loaders expect the following dataset structure in the source path location:

```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```

For rasterization, the camera models must be either a SIMPLE_PINHOLE or PINHOLE camera. We provide a converter script ```convert.py```, to extract undistorted images and SfM information from input images. Optionally, you can use ImageMagick to resize the undistorted images. This rescaling is similar to MipNeRF360, i.e., it creates images with 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 the original resolution in corresponding folders. To use them, please first install a recent version of COLMAP (ideally CUDA-powered) and ImageMagick. Put the images you want to use in a directory ```<location>/input```.
```
<location>
|---input
    |---<image 0>
    |---<image 1>
    |---...
```
 If you have COLMAP and ImageMagick on your system path, you can simply run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```
Alternatively, you can use the optional parameters ```--colmap_executable``` and ```--magick_executable``` to point to the respective paths. Please note that on Windows, the executable should point to the COLMAP ```.bat``` file that takes care of setting the execution environment. Once done, ```<location>``` will contain the expected COLMAP data set structure with undistorted, resized input images, in addition to your original images and some temporary (distorted) data in the directory ```distorted```.

If you have your own COLMAP dataset without undistortion (e.g., using ```OPENCV``` camera), you can try to just run the last part of the script: Put the images in ```input``` and the COLMAP info in a subdirectory ```distorted```:
```
<location>
|---input
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---distorted
    |---database.db
    |---sparse
        |---0
            |---...
```
Then run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> --skip_matching [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for convert.py</span></summary>

  #### --no_gpu
  Flag to avoid using GPU in COLMAP.
  #### --skip_matching
  Flag to indicate that COLMAP info is available for images.
  #### --source_path / -s
  Location of the inputs.
  #### --camera 
  Which camera model to use for the early matching steps, ```OPENCV``` by default.
  #### --resize
  Flag for creating resized versions of input images.
  #### --colmap_executable
  Path to the COLMAP executable (```.bat``` on Windows).
  #### --magick_executable
  Path to the ImageMagick executable.

### Training speed acceleration

We integrated the drop-in replacements from [Taming-3dgs](https://humansensinglab.github.io/taming-3dgs/)<sup>1</sup> with [fused ssim](https://github.com/rahul-goel/fused-ssim/tree/main) into the original codebase to speed up training times. Once installed, the accelerated rasterizer delivers a **$\times$ 1.6 training time speedup** using `--optimizer_type default` and a **$\times$ 2.7 training time speedup** using `--optimizer_type sparse_adam`.

To get faster training times you must first install the accelerated rasterizer to your environment:

```bash
pip uninstall diff-gaussian-rasterization -y
cd submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
rm -r build
git checkout 3dgs_accel
pip install .
```

Then you can add the following parameter to use the sparse adam optimizer when running `train.py`:

```bash
--optimizer_type sparse_adam
```

*Note that this custom rasterizer has a different behaviour than the original version, for more details on training times please see [stats for training times](results.md/#training-times-comparisons)*.

### Depth regularization

To have better reconstructed scenes we use depth maps as priors during optimization with each input images. It works best on untextured parts ex: roads and can remove floaters. Several papers have used similar ideas to improve various aspects of 3DGS; (e.g. [DepthRegularizedGS](https://robot0321.github.io/DepthRegGS/index.html), [SparseGS](https://formycat.github.io/SparseGS-Real-Time-360-Sparse-View-Synthesis-using-Gaussian-Splatting/), [DNGaussian](https://fictionarry.github.io/DNGaussian/)). The depth regularization we integrated is that used in our [Hierarchical 3DGS](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/) paper, but applied to the original 3DGS; for some scenes (e.g., the DeepBlending scenes) it improves quality significantly; for others it either makes a small difference or can even be worse. For example results showing the potential benefit and statistics on quality please see here: [Stats for depth regularization](results.md).

When training on a synthetic dataset, depth maps can be produced and they do not require further processing to be used in our method.

For real world datasets depth maps should be generated for each input images, to generate them please do the following:
1. Clone [Depth Anything v2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2?tab=readme-ov-file#usage):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2.git
    ```
2. Download weights from [Depth-Anything-V2-Large](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Large/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth?download=true) and place it under `Depth-Anything-V2/checkpoints/`
3. Generate depth maps:
   ```
   python Depth-Anything-V2/run.py --encoder vitl --pred-only --grayscale --img-path <path to input images> --outdir <output path>
   ```
5. Generate a `depth_params.json` file using:
    ```
    python utils/make_depth_scale.py --base_dir <path to colmap> --depths_dir <path to generated depths>
    ```

A new parameter should be set when training if you want to use depth regularization `-d <path to depth maps>`.

### Exposure compensation
To compensate for exposure changes in the different input images we optimize an affine transformation for each image just as in [Hierarchical 3dgs](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/).  

This can greatly improve reconstruction results for "in the wild" captures, e.g., with a smartphone when the exposure setting of the camera is not fixed. For example results showing the potential benefit and statistics on quality please see here: [Stats for exposure compensation](results.md).

Add the following parameters to enable it:
```
--exposure_lr_init 0.001 --exposure_lr_final 0.0001 --exposure_lr_delay_steps 5000 --exposure_lr_delay_mult 0.001 --train_test_exp
```
Again, other excellent papers have used similar ideas e.g. [NeRF-W](https://nerf-w.github.io/), [URF](https://urban-radiance-fields.github.io/).

### Anti-aliasing
We added the EWA Filter from [Mip Splatting](https://niujinshuchong.github.io/mip-splatting/) in our codebase to remove aliasing. It is disabled by default but you can enable it by adding `--antialiasing` when training on a scene using `train.py` or rendering using `render.py`. Antialiasing can be toggled in the SIBR viewer, it is disabled by default but you should enable it when viewing a scene trained using `--antialiasing`.

## FAQ
- *Where do I get data sets, e.g., those referenced in ```full_eval.py```?* The MipNeRF360 data set is provided by the authors of the original paper on the project site. Note that two of the data sets cannot be openly shared and require you to consult the authors directly. For Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending, please use the download links provided at the top of the page. Alternatively, you may access the cloned data (status: August 2023!) from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/camenduru/gaussian-splatting)


- *How can I use this for a much larger dataset, like a city district?* The current method was not designed for these, but given enough memory, it should work out. However, the approach can struggle in multi-scale detail scenes (extreme close-ups, mixed with far-away shots). This is usually the case in, e.g., driving data sets (cars close up, buildings far away). For such scenes, you can lower the ```--position_lr_init```, ```--position_lr_final``` and ```--scaling_lr``` (x0.3, x0.1, ...). The more extensive the scene, the lower these values should be. Below, we use default learning rates (left) and ```--position_lr_init 0.000016 --scaling_lr 0.001"``` (right).

- *I'm on Windows and I can't manage to build the submodules, what do I do?* Consider following the steps in the excellent video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtuigy_wYc), hopefully they should help. The order in which the steps are done is important! Alternatively, consider using the linked Colab template.

- *It still doesn't work. It says something about ```cl.exe```. What do I do?* User Henry Pearce found a workaround. You can you try adding the visual studio path to your environment variables (your version number might differ);
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\Hostx64\x64```
Then make sure you start a new conda prompt and cd to your repo location and try this;
```
conda activate gaussian_splatting
cd <dir_to_repo>/gaussian-splatting
pip install submodules\diff-gaussian-rasterization
pip install submodules\simple-knn
```

- *I'm on macOS/Puppy Linux/Greenhat and I can't manage to build, what do I do?* Sorry, we can't provide support for platforms outside of the ones we list in this README. Consider using the linked Colab template.

- *I don't have 24 GB of VRAM for training, what do I do?* The VRAM consumption is determined by the number of points that are being optimized, which increases over time. If you only want to train to 7k iterations, you will need significantly less. To do the full training routine and avoid running out of memory, you can increase the ```--densify_grad_threshold```, ```--densification_interval``` or reduce the value of ```--densify_until_iter```. Note however that this will affect the quality of the result. Also try setting ```--test_iterations``` to ```-1``` to avoid memory spikes during testing. If ```--densify_grad_threshold``` is very high, no densification should occur and training should complete if the scene itself loads successfully.

- *24 GB of VRAM for reference quality training is still a lot! Can't we do it with less?* Yes, most likely. By our calculations it should be possible with **way** less memory (~8GB). If we can find the time we will try to achieve this. If some PyTorch veteran out there wants to tackle this, we look forward to your pull request!


- *How can I use the differentiable Gaussian rasterizer for my own project?* Easy, it is included in this repo as a submodule ```diff-gaussian-rasterization```. Feel free to check out and install the package. It's not really documented, but using it from the Python side is very straightforward (cf. ```gaussian_renderer/__init__.py```).

- *Wait, but ```<insert feature>``` isn't optimized and could be much better?* There are several parts we didn't even have time to think about improving (yet). The performance you get with this prototype is probably a rather slow baseline for what is physically possible.

- *Something is broken, how did this happen?* We tried hard to provide a solid and comprehensible basis to make use of the paper's method. We have refactored the code quite a bit, but we have limited capacity to test all possible usage scenarios. Thus, if part of the website, the code or the performance is lacking, please create an issue. If we find the time, we will do our best to address it.
